## 💡 **Pro Tips for Best Results**

### **For Graphics & Illustrations:**
1. **Use Color Picker mode** (not AI) for precise control

3. **Pick background colors** one at a time for accuracy
4. **Enable Live Preview** to see results immediately

### **For Your Blue Icon Issue:**
1. **Click ONLY on white/background areas** 
2. **Never click on blue icons** - they'll stay intact
3. **Use tolerance 10-20** for clean white removal
4. **Perfect preservation** of all graphic elements!

### **Multiple Colors:**
- **Process one color at a time** for best control
- **Download intermediate results** 
- **Load and process again** for additional colors

if (distance <= tolerance) {
  pixel.alpha = 0; // Transparent
}
```

- **RGB color space** calculation
- **Euclidean distance** matching
